# Assignment2

# Instructions

1. Read sections 2.1 and 2.2 of "Linear Complementarity, Linear and Nonlinear
   Programming" by Katta Murty (book linked on Brightspace and below).
2. Implement Lemke's method in `solve_lcp.jl`.
3. Solve the quadratic program specified in `qp.jl` by setting it up as
   an LCP and either using your implementation of Lemke's method or the [Path
   Solver](https://github.com/chkwon/PATHSolver.jl)
4. Upload a pdf to this repository containing your solution to the following:

   A. If M is positive semidefinite (x'Mx >= 0 for all x), prove that (M+M')x = 0 whenever x'Mx = 0. 
   
   B. If z is a solution to LCP(M,q), with M positive semidefinite, prove that z+d is also a solution if 
      1.    z + d >= 0
      2.    M(z+d) + q >= 0
      3.    q'd = 0
      4.    (M + M')d = 0

Make sure tests pass for problems (2-3).
